                                FINL CHIAN is a blockchain platform that overcomes the trilemma limits of blockchain with its unique model of hash round robin (HRR) and DPOR (Delegated Proof of Reputation) and combines speed-oriented consensus algorithms and high-frequency transaction technologies based on high-speed network operations and decentralization technologies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The operation of the main network that maintains the blockchain is in nonstop operation and sustainable chaining. In addition, in order to fundamentally eradicate intentional threats to the blockchain network, a security model is needed to raise the barrier of entry for hackers. In other words, network overhead capital (NoC), which increases the cost of hackers, should be raised to establish a limit on intentional participation in the block's chain of trust.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The autonomous participatory model should be maintained, but the combination of maintaining and retaining stake suitable for the network's compensation model should be used as a means of stable currency trading operation. The governance of FINLCHAIN's mainnet lies in its limited resource operations, called the autonomous participation curve, and the high frequency network channels of high reliability. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition, the availability of our network creates accessibility that is completely different from the network flow of other blockchains, and employs a technique that creates a dense network correlation that maintains trust. The governance structure of FINL CHAIN's blockchain network is the node participant, or the Senate, and the decentralized participant model, which is the delegated participant of the consensus group composed of these nodes, is constructed so that the network operation is not distorted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As proponents, holders, and participants, these three activities will help democratic decision-making of each network's mutual interests, thereby laying the foundation for the competitiveness of the final chain's network and the growth of autonomous operations as a token economy model.

                                DPOR is a delegated proof of reputation model that combines the basis of trust with a physical model to operate the blockchain model autonomously. For this purpose, it is an independent consensus model to increase the reliability of the consensus proof network by quantifying the reliability of the devices of the multilateral consensus group into a reputation model.
